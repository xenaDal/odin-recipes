# odin-recipes
This project is a Recipe page using html which I have learnt so far. 
I want to demonstrate the use of paragraphs, bold, italics, headings, links and pictures. 
Also want to improve my git skills and create valuable informative commits to get more familiar with using it on a regular basis.
