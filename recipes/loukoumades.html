    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> Loukoumades are little bite-sized fluffy sweet honey balls (the Greek version of donuts), which are deep fried to golden and crispy perfection. 
        </p>
        <p> Greek donuts (loukoumades) are traditionally served soaked in hot honey syrup, sprinkled with cinnamon and garnished with chopped walnuts or toasted sesame seeds. Simply irresistible! 
        </p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> 2 (7g) packages active dry yeast </li>
            <li> 1 cup warm water </li>
            <li> ½ cup warm milk </li>
            <li> ¼ cup white sugar </li>
            <li> 1 teaspoon salt </li>
            <li> ⅓ cup butter, softened </li>
            <li> 3 eggs</li>
            <li> 4 cups all-purpose flour </li>
            <li> ½ cup honey </li>
            <li> ½ cup water </li>
            <li> 4 cups vegetable oil, or as needed </li>
            <li> 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon </li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li> Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water in a small bowl. The water should be no more than 100 degrees F (40 degrees C). Let stand for 5 minutes until the yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam. In a large bowl, mix the warm milk, sugar, and salt, and mix to dissolve. Pour the yeast mixture into the milk mixture, and stir to combine. </li>
            <li> Beat in the butter, eggs, and flour until the mixture forms a smooth, soft dough. Cover the bowl, and let rise until doubled in bulk, about 30 minutes. Stir the dough well, cover, and let rise 30 more minutes. </li>
            <li> Mix honey and 1/2 cup of water in a saucepan, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Turn off the heat and let the honey syrup cool. </li>
            <li> Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Oil should be about 2 inches deep. </li>
            <li> Place a large table or soup spoon in a glass of water near the batter. Scoop up about 2 tablespoons of dough per puff with the wet spoon, drop it into the wet palm of your hand, and roll it back into the spoon to create a round shape. Do not overhandle the puffy, soft dough. Drop the dough balls into the hot oil in batches, wetting the spoon each time you make a dough ball. Fry in the hot oil until golden brown on the bottom, and roll them over to cook the other side, 2 to 3 minutes per batch. Gently set the loukoumades aside to drain on paper towels. </li>
            <li> Place the loukoumades on a baking sheet, drizzle them with honey syrup, and sprinkle with cinnamon. Serve warm.</li>
