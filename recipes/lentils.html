    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> Greek lentil soup (Fakes soup) is one of the most popular winter Greek dishes, and with good reason! High in nutritional value, simple to prepare with an exquisite taste, this traditional Greek dish is the best way to promote healthier eating habits for you and your family!  
        </p>
        <p> It is traditionally served with a drizzle of olive oil and lots of vinegar. Though the vinegar is, of course, optional — try it! It lifts the lentils and adds another dimension of flavor.

            <li> 4 cups of water </li>
            <li> 2 bay leaves </li>
            <li> 1 pinch dried oregano </li>

        </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li> Place lentils in a large saucepan; add enough water to cover by 1 inch. Bring water to a boil and cook for 10 minutes; drain. </li>
            <li> Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add onion, carrot, and garlic; cook and stir until onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Pour in lentils, then add 1 quart water, bay leaves, oregano, and rosemary. Bring to a boil. Cover and reduce heat to medium-low; simmer for 10 minutes. </li>
            <li> Stir in tomato paste; season with salt and pepper. Cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, until lentils have softened, 30 to 40 minutes. Add additional water if soup becomes too thick. Drizzle with olive oil and red wine vinegar to serve. </li>
